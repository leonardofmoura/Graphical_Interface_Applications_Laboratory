# Graphical Interface Applications Laboratory

Repository created to host projects developed in the Graphical Interface Applications Laboratory course.

The course focuses in the development of three projects that more advanced computer graphics concepts, using the WebCGF library that is based in WebGL.

All projects were developed with my partner [Andr√© Santos](https://github.com/AndreLopesSantos).

### Project 1 - Development of a Graphical Engine in WebGL

Creation of a Graphic Engine that displays a scene, parsing an XML file. The parser creates a [scene graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph#Scene_graphs_in_games_and_3D_applications) using the primitives, textures, materials, lights and cameras supported. 

### Project 2 - Perfecting Computer Graphics Technics

This project adds keyframe animations, complex surfaces using [NURBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline), and render to texture (in the form of a security camera) using shaders to the previews project.

### Project 3 - Interface of a 3D game

This project uses the Engine developed in the previews two projects to implement the [Mbrane](https://github.com/leonardofmoura/Logic_Programming/tree/master/Projects/Mbrane) game in a 3D interface. It supports several gaming scenes, tile highlighting, camera movement, and computer playing. It runs the game logic (written in prolog) in a server, running in the host. The 3D interface then uses AJAX to interact with the server with several requests.
